These files are for prototype keyboards and offer no warranty or guarantee of function.

All of these keyboards require a Pro Micro or Pro Micro Elite C controller, diodes, switches and stabilizers to function.

These boards have not been ported to QMK proper - Hex files and JSON files from Kbfirmwarebuilder are provided so that you can start using the keyboards right away.

Links to KLE have been provided if you want to create your own plate files.
