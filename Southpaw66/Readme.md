These files are for prototype keyboards and offer no warranty or guarantee of function.

All of these keyboards require a Pro Micro or Pro Micro Elite C controller, diodes, switches and stabilizers to function.

These boards have not been ported to QMK proper - Hex files and JSON files from Kbfirmwarebuilder are provided so that you can start using the keyboards right away.
